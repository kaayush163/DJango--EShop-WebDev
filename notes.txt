we ahve to create app so to amnage different differnt sections like in ecommerse we ahve to amnage stores payments dispaly etc

Go to sqlliteonline.com   https://sqliteonline.com/

powerful website tos ee the table on any database

for creatifnf django username and password write command python manage.py createsuperuser
Error comes because no databse is created db sqlite (it is empty) so first need to created table to create superuser


python manage.py makemigrations
No changes deteched because notheng operation has done on table

so first run this command 
python manage.py migrate

now see in sqliteonline.com and select the file dq.sqlite3 will see so many tables has been giving by django

Now run python manage.py createsuperuser
Username:- 
Email address:- 

now will see on added to the sqliteonline.com by selecting db.sqlite3 file again now its added
and go to localhost:8000/admin and now can regeiter in django adminstration easily 



Models creation

Difference between package and directory

models.py remove it from store folder and create package folder "models"

in that create product.py and write code(take helpin from django dicumentation)
and define different parameters related to product detail but on python mange.py makemigrations still no changes detected because we ahve to write __init__.py also from there it initializes

Importance of __init__.py


IMP ISSUES FACED BY MANY
now write from .product import Product now run makemigrations command now it will give some action
even if not updating makemigrations then check in Eshop settings INSTALLED_APPS=[] need to add app here like 'store' add here also then that will work
If still not updating then write this python manage.py makemigrations store




Not: when using image field for uploading image we have to use third party pillow


then run python mange.py migrate







Admin not showing product row in url localhost:8000/admin  evn created Models structure weel 
so for this we ahve to go for store app and in admin.py we ahve to add soem commeands

from django.contrib import admin
from .models.product import Product
# Register your models here.
admin.site.register(Product)

no go back to admin url and there it willbe rpesent and can be ab=vailable to add items now


For category again mdoels create file category.py then again run 
python manage.py makemigrations
python mange.py migrate
these two commands always run on every chanegs amde

If not working giving some issue best to delete all migrations files except __Init__.py and delete dq.sqlite3 then run python mangae.oy makemigrations python manag.py migrate






Handling Requests

Eshop -> urls.py
same create in store app urls.py file that url fucntion will be call on view.py of store app
so add print in view.py but it will still not render on '/' this url of localhost

so for doing this lets go back to the Eshop->urls.py and add include package import (from .... import) and in urlpatters add the path('',include('store.urls'))   //appname.fileyou want to render

Now request recived printed at terminal but show error at webpage because it not sending any response so for that we do import HTTPRESPONSE in View.py in store app 

from django.http import HttpResponse  add in view.py
